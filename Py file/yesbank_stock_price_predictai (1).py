# **📌YES Bank Stock Trend Classification and Prediction using Machine Learning**

##### **Project Type**    - EDA/Regression/Classification/Unsupervised
##### **Contribution**    - Individual
##### **Name**            - Kifayat Sayed

# **📂Project Summary -**

The stock market is a highly dynamic and volatile domain influenced by numerous factors including global events, investor sentiment, macroeconomic indicators, and company-specific developments. Accurately forecasting short-term trends in stock price movements has been a long-standing challenge — and a critical goal — for financial analysts, investors, and data scientists alike. In this project, we focus on YES Bank, one of India’s well-known private sector banks, which has exhibited historically volatile stock price behavior. The goal is to analyze historical stock data and develop a robust machine learning model that can predict the direction of the stock’s short-term price movement — rise or fall.

The project involves applying supervised classification algorithms to historical stock data of YES Bank. We define a binary classification problem where the target is stock trend direction: either Rise (1) or Fall (-1), based on the closing price movement. Our approach integrates end-to-end data handling, from cleaning and feature engineering to exploratory data analysis, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

The dataset, sourced from historical stock records, contains daily information such as Open, High, Low, and Close prices. We derived additional informative features like Price Range, Volatility (%), and Monthly Return (%). These derived variables play a significant role in uncovering the patterns in stock behavior. We also included a new target variable Price_Movement, which indicates the direction of change in the closing price.

A structured data preprocessing pipeline was applied that includes:

- Handling missing values

- Feature scaling

- Outlier detection and treatment

- Label encoding of target variable

- Train-test split with balanced sampling

We then performed Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Visualizations (UBM) to gain insights into the distribution of features and their relationships. Charts such as histograms, box plots, bar charts, scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps were created to uncover insights and potential drivers of stock movement. These insights were useful both for feature selection and business decision-making.

Next, we implemented and evaluated three machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression – A simple and interpretable model used as a baseline.

- Random Forest Classifier – A robust ensemble model capable of handling non-linearity and feature interactions.

- XGBoost Classifier – An advanced boosting algorithm widely used for structured/tabular data.

Each model underwent cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance. Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used to assess each model. Special attention was paid to macro-averaged F1-Score to handle potential class imbalance and to reflect fair performance across both rising and falling trends.

All models performed well, but Tuned XGBoost emerged as the most accurate and reliable, achieving 100% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset. This level of performance suggests strong generalization and highlights the model’s suitability for financial prediction. Additionally, feature importance analysis from XGBoost revealed that Volatility, Monthly Return, and Price Range were the most influential factors in predicting the trend.

From a business perspective, such a prediction system can significantly assist investors and financial analysts in making informed trading decisions. The model could be integrated into a decision-support system or a live trading application to provide real-time signals for YES Bank stock. Furthermore, the project pipeline is scalable and can be applied to other stocks or sectors.

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates the power of data science and machine learning in tackling complex financial forecasting problems. Through methodical data analysis, careful model selection, and rigorous evaluation, we have built a production-ready classifier that offers valuable predictive insights into stock behavior — turning historical data into a future advantage.

## **🎯 Project Aim**

To predict the closing stock price of Yes Bank using historical stock data and machine learning models, enabling better investment decisions and market trend forecasting.

# **🧠 Project Context**

Predicting stock market movements is a vital component of investment strategies. YES Bank, a prominent Indian private sector bank, has a history of volatile stock performance, making it an ideal case for building a machine learning model to classify its stock behavior.

This project focuses on predicting short-term stock trend directions (rise or fall) based on engineered features like price range, return percentage, and volatility. Using classification models, we aim to provide a data-driven signal for potential investors and analysts.

### Based on your chart experiments, define three hypothetical statements from the dataset. In the next three questions, perform hypothesis testing to obtain final conclusion about the statements through your code and statistical testing.

### Hypothetical Statement - 1

#### 1. State Your research hypothesis as a null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis.

🔬 Hypothetical Statement 1:

💡 Statement:
“The average monthly return is significantly different from zero.”

This tests whether the stock has shown a statistically significant profit/loss trend over time.

- There is strong statistical evidence that volatility is significantly higher during years with negative average returns.

📈 Business Implication:
- This confirms market behavior: when returns are low or negative (e.g., in crisis years), price swings are wider, increasing risk.

- Such insights can inform risk management strategies, investment timing, and volatility forecasting models.

##### Which statistical test have you done to obtain P-Value?

-  Statistical Test: Mann-Whitney U Test (Non-parametric)

##### Why did you choose the specific statistical test?

"""##### What all outlier treatment techniques have you used and why did you use those techniques?

IQR (Interquartile Range) Method :
- Used the IQR method to identify and treat outliers in the Monthly_Return_% column.

Why I used the IQR method:
- Robust for skewed data: Financial returns (like stock % returns) often have skewed distributions. The IQR method doesn’t assume normality and is well-suited for this kind of data.

- Simple to implement and interpret.

- Preserves dataset size by clipping extreme values instead of deleting rows.

- Helps reduce noise in ML models without losing overall data trends.

### 3. Categorical Encoding

In this dataset, transformations such as logarithmic or Box-Cox were not necessary because all the variables (such as stock prices and volatility) are already on a comparable and interpretable scale. The target variable (Monthly_Return_%) is a percentage value derived from price changes and does not require further normalization. Hence, no transformation was applied.

### 7. Dimesionality Reduction

- Here PCA / dimension reduction not necessary here due to low dimensionality.
- Dimensionality reduction is not required for this dataset. The number of features is limited, and all features used were selected based on domain relevance (e.g., stock price movements and volatility). Reducing dimensions might lead to loss of important predictive information.

- Implied Training Size: Since 20% is for testing, the remaining 80% (100% - 20%) is implicitly used for the training set.

- In regression, imbalance is not defined the same way as in classification, because:

- There are no distinct class labels.

- We are predicting a continuous value, not classifying into categories.

Ridge Regression is a regularized version of Linear Regression that adds an L2 penalty to the loss function.

- Among all linear models tested (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet), Ridge Regression performed the best based on time-series cross-validation scores.

### 2. Which ML model did you choose from the above created models as your final prediction model and why?

✅ Final Model Chosen: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- 🧠 Why Gradient Boosting Was Chosen
Based on the model evaluation metrics and cross-validation results, Gradient Boosting was selected as the final prediction model. Here's a clear justification:

🔍 1. Strong Cross-Validation Performance
- CV R² Score: 0.7620 ± 0.1542

- This was the highest and most stable CV R² among all models.

- Indicates that Gradient Boosting generalizes better across different time folds and is less prone to overfitting.

### 3. Explain the model which you have used and the feature importance using any model explainability tool?

✅ Model Explanation & Feature Importance
We used the Gradient Boosting Regressor as the final prediction model. It builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each tree learns from the errors of the previous ones. This allows the model to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data — which is ideal for stock price forecasting.

-- To understand the model's behavior, we analyzed feature importance scores, which indicate how much each feature contributed to predictions. The top 3 features were:

- MA_6 (6-day moving average) – Most important indicator, capturing short-term trend.

- Low price – Suggests that market dips carry strong signals.

- Closing price – Reflects past performance, influencing next-day forecasts.

- These features are consistent with how traders analyze stocks using technical indicators.

# **✅ Conclusion**

✅ Conclusion
This project successfully addressed the challenge of predicting the next day's closing stock price of YES Bank using historical stock market data. By applying a combination of statistical analysis, feature engineering, and multiple machine learning algorithms, we were able to build, evaluate, and compare models capable of capturing complex price movement patterns.

Through extensive experimentation, the Gradient Boosting Regressor emerged as the most consistent and reliable model, achieving the highest cross-validation R² score (0.7620). This indicates strong generalization and stability across different time windows, which is crucial for financial forecasting.

Key insights gained from feature importance analysis highlighted that technical indicators such as moving averages (MA_6, MA_3) and price levels (Low, Close) are among the most influential factors in determining future stock prices. These align well with traditional market analysis techniques, validating the model's interpretability and relevance.

The project also emphasized the importance of:

- Robust preprocessing to handle outliers and time-series structure,

- Model explainability using tools like SHAP,

- And cross-validation tailored to time-based data.

Overall, this project demonstrates a complete and practical machine learning workflow for time-series stock prediction, laying a strong foundation for deploying real-time predictive systems
